Merge Sort: It is well-suited for sorting large datasets and can be efficiently used in external sorting algorithms (e.g., for sorting data stored on disks).


Merge Sort: It is a recursive algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays until the base case (single-element arrays) is reached and then merges them back together.





Quick Sort: It is usually faster in practice for small to medium-sized arrays. Additionally, its in-place sorting nature makes it suitable for situations with limited memory.

It is also a recursive algorithm that divides the array into subarrays but does not explicitly merge them. Instead, the sorting is done in-place during the partitioning process.
